# üß†üñºÔ∏è ImagePrompt-MemoryBot

> A multimodal AI chatbot that transforms static image interpretation into **conversational image analysis** ‚Äî backed by **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, structured **session memory**, and advanced **prompt engineering**.

---

## üìå Overview

**ImagePrompt-MemoryBot** is an intelligent image analysis chatbot system that enables users to upload an image and have a dynamic, visually-grounded conversation about it. Built using **FastAPI**, **vanilla JavaScript**, and **RAG-enhanced LLM communication**, this system maintains **session-aware memory**, enabling context retention across multiple queries in real time.

Unlike conventional chatbots that forget after a prompt, this system **remembers** ‚Äî and more importantly, it **grounds** all its answers in the actual visual content of the uploaded image.

- üì∑ **Image upload with preprocessing**: Quality control, compression, and base64 conversion.
- üí¨ **Real-time interactive chatbot UI**: Seamless and responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- üß† **Session memory management**: Hybrid (in-memory + JSON) memory for persistent, structured conversations.
- üß© **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: All answers grounded in visual facts from the image.
- üéØ **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Carefully constructed prompts to reduce hallucinations and ensure factual accuracy.
- üõ†Ô∏è **FastAPI backend**: Modular, high-performance API with async support.
- üìà **Performance optimized and scalable**: Docker-ready, frontend caching, semantic vector filtering.
